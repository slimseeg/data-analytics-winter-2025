## How to use this Template 

In your forked repository, edit the markdown file below with your planned study hours that total a _minimum of 10 hours a week_. 

Some weeks will be lighter, some will be more difficult. 

On the lighter weeks you can use the extra time to watch YouTube videos on data related topics you are interested in or find additional learning resources in the Data Analytics Resources [repo](https://github.com/tech-moms/data-analytics-resources).

  > hi! I am in a data analytics class and need to carve out 10 hours a week to study. Can you help me create a study plan - I study best in the evenings after my kids go to bed at 10pm. I can commit to one after after bedtime and maybe one hour in the morning before they get up from 7am - 8am. I can do this study plan on the weekdays and I can put in some extra time on Sunday mornings between 9am and 12pm. Can you put the plan into markdown?
